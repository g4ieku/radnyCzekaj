## 📐 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Install dependencies 👉 npm install
3. Build CSS from Sass 👉 npm run sass:build
4. Watch for changes during development 👉 npm run sass:watch

## 🚀 Customization
- To customize colors, fonts, etc., you can modify variables in the Bootstrap.scss file,
- Avoid modifying Bootstrap’s internal _variables.scss directly (found in node_modules/bootstrap/...) as updates may overwrite it. Instead, override via your own styles (e.g. in styles.scss),
- Add custom styles in styles.scss or within the SCSS folder as appropriate.
